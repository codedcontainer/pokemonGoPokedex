# Pokémon Go Pokédex Web Application #
## Background
Pokémon Go is different than the original GameBoy games in that in order to evolve a Pokémon you have to collect enough candies. The number of candies needed vary between each Pokémon. When you catch a Pokémon you are awarded a collection of candies and when you transfer or essentially delete a Pokémon from your bag you are also awarded a single candy. The other way a trainer can receive candy is by walking with a Pokémon. The app will track by GPS the number of KM's you walk even when the app is not running. The distance requirement can very from 2KM to 20KM.

## Motivation
To create a user friendly application that allows a trainer to see which Pokémon they should walk with next sorted by the number of miles required and quickly fill up their Pokédex.
